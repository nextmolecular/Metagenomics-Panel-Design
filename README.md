# Metagenomics-Panel-Design
Improved workflow design for designing the Metagenomics panel

* Identification of Open Reading Frames in different strains of species 
   
* Identification of Conserved open reading frames using Megablast

* Identification of 150BP oligos from conserved open reading frames that are conserved among all strains of species

* Filtering of conserved 150BP oligoes by sequence complexity and  GC content 

* Screening of 150-mers by lack of homology to representative Prokaryotic, Viral, and Eurkaryotic Genomes

* Selection of primers to generate 100 Amplicons/species-target that are uniformly
  arrayed accross the genome of the organism.

* Screening of primers by by lack of homology to representative Prokaryotic, Viral, and Eurkaryotic Genomes
